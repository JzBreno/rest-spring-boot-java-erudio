# üöÄ REST API with Spring Boot and Java

This project is a complete RESTful API implementation, developed using the **Spring Boot** framework and the **Java** language. It serves as a repository for learning and practicing essential concepts of modern backend development, covering everything from initial configuration to data persistence and the implementation of architectural patterns like HATEOAS.

The project is based on the development guides and best practices promoted by **Erudio Treinamentos**.

## üåü Project Highlights

* **Complete RESTful CRUD:** Implementation of the four basic operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for core resources (e.g., `Person`, `Book`, etc.).
* **Spring Boot:** Utilization of Spring Boot for rapid configuration and standalone application execution.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Simplified data persistence, using Hibernate as the JPA provider.
* **Content Negotiation:** Support for different media types (JSON, XML, and/or YAML).
* **HATEOAS:** Implementation of the HATEOAS (Hypermedia as an Engine of Application State) principle to add navigation links to API responses.
* **Exception Handling:** Implementation of a global exception handler to return clear HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages.
* **Security (Optional/To Be Added):** Foundation for implementing security with Spring Security (JWT/OAuth2 authentication).
* **Documentation (Optional/To Be Added):** Integration with Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive API documentation.
